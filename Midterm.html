			<p> <strong> Free Tibet </strong> is a non-profit, <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization" target= "_blank"> non-governmental organisation </a>, founded in 1987 and based in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target= "_blank">London,</a> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target= "_blank"> England </a>. Free Tibet, according to their mission statement, advocates for <i>“a free <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet" target= "_blank">Tibet </a> in which Tibetans are able to determine their own future and the <b> <u>human rights of all </u> </b> are respected.”</i>[1] </p>

			<br>

			<p> The organisation is a member of the <u> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tibet_Network" target= "_blank"> International Tibet Network (ITN) </a> </u>, a worldwide group of affiliated organisations campaigning for <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights" target= "_blank"> human rights </a> and self-determination in Tibet.[2] </p>

			<br>

			<p>According to their website Free Tibet campaigns for an end to what it calls <i> "<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" target= "_blank">China</a>'s occupation of Tibet" </i> and for international recognition of Tibetans' right to freedom. They mobilize active support for the Tibetan cause, champion human rights, and challenge those whose actions sustain what they see as occupation. </p>

		<h2> <a name="Political"> <b>Political prisoners <b> </a> </h2>

			<p id="PP"> As a result of <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China" target= "_blank">China’s censorship </a>, many political dissenters are arrested and imprisoned for promoting or expressing religious, social, economic, and political principles the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" target= "_blank"> Communist Party of China </a> (CPC) disapproves of.[3][4] Free Tibet seeks the release of political prisoners through <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_Kingdom" target= "_blank">lobbying </a> political leaders, circulating petitions, and organising Urgent Action Campaigns. This approach has been successful in securing the early release of prominent political prisoners such as <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuntsog_Nyidron" target= "_blank">Phuntso Nyidon </a>,[5] reducing <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzin_Delek_Rinpoche" target= "_blank"> Tenzin Delek Rinpoche</a>'s sentence from a death sentence to life in prison and was possibly influential in ensuring  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runggye_Adak" target= "_blank">Runggye Adak</a>'s relatively low-length sentence in 2007. Free Tibet maintains a list of current prisoners, released prisoners, and those that have received death sentences.[6] </p>

		<h2> <a name="gar"> Save Larung Gar </a> </h2>

			<p>In June 2016, Free Tibet received reports that <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larung_Gar_Buddhist_Academy" target= "_blank">Larung Gar Buddhist Academy </a> in eastern Tibet was soon to undergo a series of evictions and demolitions.[7] An order issued by the government of Serta County stated that the population was to be reduced to a maximum of 5,000 residents over the next 15 months, down from the well over 10,000 living there at the time. The order also imposed a system of joint management on the monastery, with <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" target= "_blank">Chinese Communist Party </a> officials outnumbering monastic officials three to two under the new regime. The monastery was also required to hand over financial management to Chinese authorities.[7] The work at Larung Gar began on 20 July 2016, as residents were moved out and their residences demolished.[8] Free Tibet was able to garner media attention for the situation at Larung Gar with stories in the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News" target= "_blank">BBC</a>,[9] <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times" target= "_blank">The Times </a>[10] and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" target= "_blank">The New York Times </a>[11] among others.[12][13] Free Tibet helped to organise a series of world-wide protests at Chinese embassies[14] and also initiated an online petition and various emailing campaigns directed at the<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Work_Department" target= "_blank"> United Front Work Department </a>, Chinese Embassies and Foreign Ministers. Following on from these, the situation at Larung Gar was brought up by the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" target= "_blank">US State Department </a>,[15] the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lantos_Human_Rights_Commission" target= "_blank">Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission </a>[14] as well as various Canadian and British MPs.[16][17] </p>

		<h2> <a name="campaign"> InterContinental: Parasites in Paradise </a> </h2>
		<div class="img"> <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/5/23/1369324857811/Potala-palace-in-Lhasa-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c356d9a2f3a8caf0793aa91b7387381" alt="Protestors"> InterContinental Hotel </div>
		<ul id="list">
			<li> In 2013 Free Tibet launched the Parasites in Paradise campaign to protest Intercontinental Hotels' opening of the Lhasa Paradise Hotel in Tibet. </li>
			<li>Together with Students for a Free Tibet, Free Tibet called for a boycott of InterContinental Hotels, asserting that the Lhasa Paradise Hotel was little more than a "PR coup for the Chinese government" and that the marginalisation of the Tibetan people will only increase with the building of the hotel.[18] On their website Free Tibet writes that, "Intercontinental will sell the image of a peaceful, spiritual and unspoiled land, but after more than 60 years of military occupation by the world’s largest dictatorship, Tibet is no paradise."[19] Additionally, it has been argued that the Tibetan people themselves would not benefit from any jobs or opportunities which would be created by the hotel's opening as the hotel's staff will speak Chinese, a language most Tibetans cannot speak. Tibetan illiteracy is a major concern of many activists and scholars as Chinese is the language of economic, social, and political life in Tibet.[20][21] </li>
			<li>In addition to the boycott, Free Tibet sent a petition of over 10,500 signatures to InterContinental's chief executive Richard Solomons. The petition called for Solomons to pull InterContinental out of Lhasa because IHG's operation of a hotel in Tibet, where China's human rights violations have been especially prominent, "is in direct contradiction to Intercontinental's Corporate Social Responsibility policies." Free Tibet also organised protests in London in an effort to sway InterContinental.[22][23] </li>
		</ul>
		

		<h2> <a name="torture"> Stop Torture campaign </a> </h2>

		<p>Investigations into China's  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_China" target= "_blank">human rights situation</a> have shown that torture is used routinely in many prisons and interrogations.[24] In 2008 Free Tibet submitted evidence to the  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Torture#Committee_against_Torture" target= "_blank">UN Committee Against Torture</a> in  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva" target= "_blank">Geneva</a> detailing the record of abuse inside Tibet. Subsequently the UN Committee concluded that torture in Tibet is "widespread and routine".[25]

		Free Tibet has also worked alongside celebrities such as  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman" target= "_blank">Alan Rickman </a>,  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Threlfall" target= "_blank">David Threlfall </a>,  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliet_Stevenson" target= "_blank">Juliet Stevenson </a>, and  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_West" target= "_blank">Dominic West</a> to record testimonies of tortured Tibetans.[26] The organisation used the video testimonies to create more awareness and urge people to take action by writing to  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hague" target= "_blank">William Hague </a> and Chinese political representatives to put a stop to torture in Tibet.[27]

		In 2004 Free Tibet organised a UK tour for  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palden_Gyatso" target= "_blank">Palden Gyatso </a>, a Tibetan monk who was arrested during the Chinese invasion of Tibet.[28] Gyatso spent 33 years in Chinese prisons and  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_camp" target= "_blank">labor camps</a> enduring systematic  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture" target= "_blank">torture</a> after being arrested for calling for Tibet's freedom.[29][30] Gyatso was released in 1992 and escaped to  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" target= "_blank">India </a>, he has since toured the world spreading awareness about human rights violations in Tibet. During the 2004 tour he spoke at numerous conventions, and events.[31]

		In February 2015 Free Tibet joined with their research partner, Tibet Watch, to write a report on Chinese torture in Tibet.[32][33] The report, "Torture in Tibet," it was submitted to the United Nations Committee Against Torture. "Torture in Tibet" documents torture survivor testimonies from Golog Jigme, Tenzin Namgyal, and Kelsang Tsundue, Tibetan deaths in custody, deaths resulting from torture, and a number of prisoners who they believe to be at particular risk of torture.[34] </p>
